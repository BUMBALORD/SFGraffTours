A student project for DevBootcamp SF, built in April of 2015.

Utilizing the Google Maps API and the Intagram API, SFGraffTours will search for hashtags on photos in Instagram and pin their location to a map so that users can find the artwork in real life.

Sadly, Instagram's API returns geolocation data for pictures from where they are uploaded from, not taken from, so the project didn't really work. Instead, I added an AJAX-ified search and display of pics, and then hardcoded a few pins into the app, for the means of showcasing how the app whould have worked.
